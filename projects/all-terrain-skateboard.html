  <h1>All-Terrain Electric Mountainboard</h1>
  <p class="project-subtitle">
    High-torque, all-wheel-drive electric skateboard designed to bridge skateboarding,
    hiking, and off-road exploration.
  </p>

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      As someone who has skateboarded for years while also spending significant time
      hiking and mountain biking, I wanted to design a platform that combined the
      agility and freedom of skateboarding with the terrain capability of off-road travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional electric skateboards perform well on pavement but fail when faced
      with loose gravel, dirt, roots, rocks, and elevation changes. This project explores
      what it takes to build a skateboard that can confidently traverse rough terrain
      while remaining controllable, efficient, and safe.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining traction across loose and uneven terrain</li>
      <li>Traversing large obstacles without rider instability</li>
      <li>Balancing agility with stability at speed</li>
      <li>Delivering sufficient torque without overheating</li>
      <li>Achieving long-range battery life for extended rides</li>
      <li>Ensuring rider safety during aggressive off-road use</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- MECHANICAL DESIGN -->
  <section>
    <h2>Mechanical Design & Suspension</h2>
    <p>
      To address harsh terrain and rider fatigue, I designed a custom suspension system
      that significantly smooths out impacts from rocks, roots, and uneven surfaces.
      This allows the board to maintain wheel contact with the ground, improving both
      comfort and traction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larger off-road tires with deep treads were selected to roll over obstacles that
      would stop traditional skateboards entirely. The increased diameter improves
      obstacle clearance while the tread pattern provides grip on dirt, gravel, and grass.
    </p>

         style="margin:2rem 0; border-radius:12px;">

    <p>
      Wider trucks were used to increase lateral stability, but they were intentionally
      tuned looser to preserve a sharp turning radius. This combination allows the board
      to remain agile while still feeling planted at speed.
    </p>

  <!-- POWERTRAIN -->
  <section>
    <h2>Drivetrain, Motors & Traction Control</h2>
    <p>
      The board uses a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration, with each motor
      controlled by its own dedicated VESC. This architecture enables independent
      torque control at each wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      By monitoring wheel speed and motor current, the system can reduce or cut power
      when excessive slip is detected, effectively acting as traction control. This is
      critical on loose terrain where uncontrolled wheelspin can lead to loss of control
      or inefficient power usage.
    </p>

         style="margin:2rem 0; border-radius:12px;">

    <p>
      This all-wheel-drive setup dramatically improves climbing ability, stability under
      acceleration, and control during technical riding conditions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- BATTERY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Battery System & Range</h2>
    <p>
      A high-capacity battery pack was designed and assembled to provide approximately
      <strong>43 miles of range</strong> under typical riding conditions. Cell selection,
      configuration, and current handling were optimized to support sustained high torque
      output without excessive voltage sag.
    </p>

         style="margin:2rem 0; border-radius:12px;">

         alt="Battery pack construction"
         style="margin:2rem 0; border-radius:12px;">

    <p>
      The battery system was designed with serviceability and safety in mind, allowing
      for inspection, maintenance, and future upgrades.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- RIDER SAFETY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Rider Safety & Control</h2>
    <p>
      Off-road riding introduces the risk of foot slippage, especially when traversing
      uneven or inclined terrain. To address this, the board includes removable foot
      straps that can be secured during aggressive riding conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These straps help keep the rider connected to the board over rough terrain while
      remaining optional. When riding on smoother surfaces such as pavement, packed dirt,
      or grass, the straps can be removed to restore a traditional skateboard feel.
    </p>

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      The final system successfully merges the agility of a skateboard with the terrain
      capability of off-road vehicles. The suspension, AWD drivetrain, traction control,
      and battery system work together to create a stable, controllable, and highly
      capable electric mountainboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project reinforced the importance of holistic system design — mechanical,
      electrical, and control decisions are deeply interconnected, especially in
      high-performance robotics and mobility platforms.
