  <!-- MISSION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Mission & Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The human hand is one of the most complex and capable tools in existence.
      It allows us to manipulate objects, feel our environment, and interact
      with the world in incredibly nuanced ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replicating these capabilities in robotic systems is critical for the future
      of assistive technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and human-robot interaction.
      A truly dexterous robotic hand could restore independence to amputees, enable
      robots to safely work alongside humans, and dramatically expand what machines
      are capable of doing in unstructured environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project focuses on understanding and recreating the fundamental mechanics
      and sensing capabilities that make the human hand so effective.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MECHANICAL GOALS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Dexterous Motion & Finger Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      One of the primary challenges in humanoid manipulation is replicating the
      range of motion present in human fingers. Unlike simple grippers, human
      hands rely on coordinated finger curling, extension, and splaying to
      interact with objects of varying shapes and sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project explores mechanical and kinematic approaches to mimic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finger curling for grasping and power grips</li>
      <li>Finger extension for release and repositioning</li>
      <li>Finger splaying to adapt to wide or irregular objects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The design emphasizes anatomical inspiration while balancing mechanical
      simplicity, strength, and scalability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SENSING -->
  <section>
    <h2>Tactile Sensing & Artificial Skin</h2>
    <p>
      Human hands do far more than move — they sense. Touch provides critical
      feedback about force, temperature, and surface texture, allowing us to
      adjust our grip in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major research direction of this project is the integration of distributed
      sensing throughout the hand, similar to how human skin functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planned sensing capabilities include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pressure sensing to detect grip force and contact location</li>
      <li>Temperature sensing for safe human interaction</li>
      <li>Surface roughness estimation to identify materials and textures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This sensory feedback will enable more adaptive, compliant, and safe
      manipulation strategies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONTROL -->
  <section>
    <h2>Control Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      True dexterity requires tight integration between mechanics, sensing,
      and control. The long-term vision for this system is closed-loop,
      sensor-driven control that continuously adjusts finger motion based
      on real-world feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than relying solely on predefined grasps, the goal is to allow
      the hand to adapt dynamically to objects, uncertainty, and external
      disturbances — much like a human would.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FUTURE WORK -->
  <section>
    <h2>Future Development & Research Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Refined finger kinematics for increased range of motion</li>
      <li>High-resolution tactile sensor arrays across fingertips and palm</li>
      <li>Force-controlled grasping using real-time sensor feedback</li>
      <li>Integration with vision systems for object-aware manipulation</li>
      <li>Learning-based grasp optimization using reinforcement learning</li>
      <li>Application to assistive robotics and humanoid platforms</li>
    </ul>
