    Mechanical, thermal, and process optimizations to improve print quality,

  </p>

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      3D printers are powerful tools because they allow anyone to create unique,
      custom parts on demand. However, they also come with major limitations:
      long print times, inconsistent quality, and reliability issues when
      trying to iterate quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I modified my printer to directly address these issues, focusing on
      reducing warping, improving surface quality, shortening iteration time,
      and increasing overall reliability during long prints.
    </p>

  <!-- WARPING PROBLEM -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solving Print Warping</h2>
    <p>
      One of the biggest issues I encountered was warping at the bottom of prints.
      This is caused by thermal stress from the heated build plate, which is needed
      for adhesion but can distort parts as they cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      I evaluated two approaches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using supports (which increased print time and material usage)</li>
      <li>Reducing build plate temperature while improving surface adhesion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I chose the second approach to maintain fast iteration speeds without
      sacrificing part quality.
    </p>

  </section>

  <!-- BUILD PLATE MOD -->
  <section>
    <h2>Build Plate Upgrade</h2>
    <p>
      I replaced the original glass build plate with a fiberglass plate.
      The rougher surface allows filament to mechanically grip into
      microscopic crevices, dramatically improving adhesion at lower
      temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change eliminated the need for glue, reduced warping, and made
      part removal easier by allowing the plate to flex instead of prying
      prints off a rigid glass surface.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- NOZZLE SYSTEM -->
  <section>
    <h2>Interchangeable Nozzle System</h2>
    <p>
      The nozzle plays a critical role in print quality and speed. Smaller
      nozzles produce finer detail but dramatically increase print time,
      while larger nozzles allow faster prints at the cost of resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I modified the printer to support interchangeable nozzles, allowing
      me to choose the optimal nozzle size depending on the application:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thin nozzles for high-precision parts</li>
      <li>Larger nozzles for rapid prototyping and structural components</li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <!-- THERMAL TUNING -->
  <section>
    <h2>Thermal Calibration & Material Testing</h2>
    <p>
      I performed extensive testing with nozzle temperature to balance print
      quality, strength, and reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through experimentation, I found <strong>210 °C</strong> to be the optimal
      printing temperature:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower temperatures caused under-extrusion and weak layer bonding</li>
      <li>Higher temperatures caused stringing and overly glossy surfaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This tuning significantly improved surface finish and reduced failed prints.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- RELIABILITY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Reliability & Print Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      To improve reliability during long prints, I implemented a system that
      allows me to monitor prints remotely from my computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also configured automatic power-loss recovery, allowing the printer
      to pause a build if power is lost and resume from the exact point where
      it stopped once power is restored. This prevented multi-day prints from
      being lost due to brief outages.
    </p>
