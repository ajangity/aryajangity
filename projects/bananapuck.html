    Chest-worn assistive monitoring device for elderly & rehabilitation patients
  </p>

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      BananaPuck is a compact, adhesive wearable designed to continuously monitor
      physiological signals, movement, and environmental context for elderly individuals
      and patients recovering from injury or surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system enables early detection of health risks while preserving user independence,
      extending caregiver awareness beyond clinical environments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Embedded sensors collect real-time data including heart rate, respiration,
      temperature, motion, orientation, and GPS location. Data is processed by an
      onboard microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly to a cloud backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caregivers access this information through a web-based dashboard that provides
      live status, intelligent alerts, and historical trends.
    </p>

    <p><strong>High-Level Architecture:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Sensors → Microcontroller → Wireless Transmission → Server Processing →
      Caregiver Application
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Many medical emergencies are preceded by subtle physiological or behavioral
      changes that go unnoticed. BananaPuck captures these early indicators, allowing
      caregivers to intervene before critical events occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system balances safety and autonomy by providing continuous monitoring
      without restricting daily activity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DASHBOARD -->
  <section>
    <h2>Caregiver Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      The BananaPuck web dashboard presents live and historical patient data in a
      clear, actionable format. It is designed for rapid interpretation under
      high-stress conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Live Map & Location Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      A real-time map view displays the patient’s current GPS location, enabling
      fast response in the event of an emergency or fall.
    </p>

    <h3>Alert System</h3>
    <p>
      The alert panel highlights critical events such as detected falls, unsafe
      heart rates, or prolonged inactivity. Each alert includes timestamps and
      contextual information to reduce false positives and alert fatigue.
    </p>

    <h3>Vitals Monitoring</h3>
    <p>
      Dedicated cards display heart rate, respiration, and temperature in real time.
      Visual cues distinguish safe and unsafe ranges for quick assessment.
    </p>

    <h3>Environmental & Context Data</h3>
    <p>
      Additional panels track environmental factors such as water submergence and
      carbon monoxide exposure, as well as positional confidence from GPS accuracy.
    </p>

      <h2>Caregiver Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        BananaPuck includes a web-based caregiver dashboard designed for fast,
        intuitive monitoring of patient status in real time.
      </p>

      <h3>Live Location Map</h3>
      <p>
        The dashboard displays the patient’s real-time GPS position on an interactive
        map, enabling rapid response during emergencies or falls.
      </p>

      <h3>Alerts & Event Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Critical alerts such as fall detection or unsafe heart rate conditions are
        surfaced immediately, along with timestamps and contextual data to reduce
        false positives.
      </p>

      <h3>Vitals Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        Heart rate, respiration, and temperature are continuously tracked and displayed
        using clear visual cards optimized for rapid assessment.
      </p>

      <h3>Environment & Context</h3>
      <p>
        Environmental awareness includes water submergence detection and carbon monoxide
        levels, providing additional context for patient safety.

  <!-- SENSOR LOGIC -->
  <section>
    <h2>Sensor Fusion & Event Detection</h2>
    <p>
      Fall detection is implemented using accelerometer and gyroscope data combined
      with temporal thresholds and post-event motion analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      If movement is detected after a fall-like event, alerts are automatically
      de-escalated to prevent unnecessary caregiver intervention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- POWER -->
  <section>
    <h2>Power & Wearability</h2>
    <p>
      BananaPuck is designed to be lightweight, unobtrusive, and comfortable for
      extended wear. Firmware scheduling and sensor polling are optimized to
      maximize battery life while maintaining continuous monitoring.
    </p>
