            <p>
              Co-founded BananaBots with the mission of building assistive technologies
              that improve safety, independence, and quality of life for elderly and
              rehabilitation patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Led end-to-end engineering across hardware, embedded firmware, and
              cloud-connected systems. Designed wearable vital-tracking devices,
              fall-detection pipelines, and real-time caregiver dashboards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Worked closely with UCSC faculty mentors to prototype, test, and iterate
              rapidly, balancing engineering rigor with real-world usability and
              patient comfort.
